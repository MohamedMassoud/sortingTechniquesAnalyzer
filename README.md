# Sorting Techniques Analyzer
Simple program to compare running time against input size of the most famous sorting algorithms.
- This is a simple comparison between the most famous sorting algorithms (Bubble, Insertion, Heap, Merge & Quick sorting algorithms).
- The user can choose the input size ranging from 10 to 10,000,000 random arrays. 
- The user can choose which sorting algorithm to use, or can choose to Multi-analyze and generate an excel file to compare the running time of each algorithm against input size.
- The user can also specify the accuracy of the results by specifying the number of plot points.  
- The heap sort is represented in a simple graphical representation to show the process of heap sort.
